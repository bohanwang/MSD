# Medial Skeletal Diagram: A Generalized Medial Axis Approach for Compact 3D Shape Representation

This repository contains the implementation code for our conditionally accepted SIGGRAPH Asia paper [Medial Skeletal Diagram: A Generalized Medial Axis Approach for Compact 3D Shape Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09395) (This is the arXiv version, the published version will come soon).

![overview](assets/teaser.png)
**We introduce the Medial Skeletal Diagram (MSD) -- a compact and versatile skeletal representation that generalizes the medial axis.** Our representation reduces the number of discrete elements ($N_d$) required compared to both standard and simplified medial axes ((b) and (d)). This reduction is achieved while delivering the highest reconstruction accuracy (c). The compactness of discrete elements and the completeness of our method facilitate a broad range of applications, such as shape generation, mesh decomposition, and shape optimization (e).

## Installation

1. Download [libpgo](https://github.com/bohanwang/libpgo), a C++ library with Python bindings for **P**hysically-based simulation, **G**eometric shape modeling, and **O**ptimization. Follow the instructions in the original [repo](https://github.com/bohanwang/libpgo) to get ``libpgo``.

```bash
```

2. Clone this repo into the ``{libpgo_ROOT}/projects`` folder.
